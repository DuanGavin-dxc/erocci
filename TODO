# Move OCCI schemas declaration to backends

Storage backends (like mnesia) are generic and then can get schema
from user, but this is special case.

# Backend/store:
 Optimize multiple backend requests: backends declare their
 categories, so store could be able to know which backend needs to be
 requested.
