# Backend/store:
 Optimize multiple backend requests: backends declare their
 categories, so store could be able to know which backend needs to be
 requested.

# Parsers
Migrate to single parse/3 API with state containing request type (see
   text/occi and text/plain parsers)

# Do not use dynamic atoms !!!

Replace list_to_atom with list_to_existing_atom

# Categories management

occi_category_mgr must not return actions separatly from kind/mixin

# OCCI meta-model
 Handle OCCI inheritance
