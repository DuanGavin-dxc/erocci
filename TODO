# Backend/store:
 Optimize multiple backend requests: backends declare their
 categories, so store could be able to know which backend needs to be
 requested.

# Parsers
Migrate to single parse/3 API with state containing request type (see
   text/occi and text/plain parsers)

# User mixins

Remove all hacks with mixin/user mixin
Replace with authorization mechanism: 
* user mixin is owned by the user
* model mixin has special owner: read-only (or equiv)
