erOCCI
------

erOCCI is a framework for building OCCI like API (similar to rOCCI or
pyOCNI), with the following objectives:
- 100% compliance with OCCI specifications (core and rendering)
- scalability
- clear separation between 
  - rendering: text/occi, text/plain, application/occi+json, etc.
  - transport: HTTP, etc (XMPP planned)
  - backends: storage (Riak, etc.), "procci" to other APIs
- small and heavily tested (planned.. but some unit tests already there)
